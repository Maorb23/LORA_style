His pale grey eyes shone and\ntwinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire\nburnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the\nlilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our\nglasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather\nthan submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious\nafter-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the\ntrammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the\npoints with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his\nearnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity.", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 0, "word_count": 196}

The geometry, for instance,\nthey taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”\n\n“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said\nFilby, an argumentative person with red hair.\n\n“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground\nfor it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of\ncourse that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real\nexistence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane.\nThese things are mere abstractions.”\n\n“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a\nreal existence.”\n\n“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All\nreal things—”\n\n“So most people think. But wait a moment.

{"text": "[H.G.

But through a natural\ninfirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we\nincline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three\nwhich we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,\nhowever, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former\nthree dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our\nconsciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter\nfrom the beginning to the end of our lives.”\n\n“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his\ncigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 2, "word_count": 129}
{"text": "[H.G.

It\nis only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between\nTime and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our\nconsciousness moves along it_.

{"text": "[H.G. Wells Style]\n“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is\nspoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,\nBreadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three\nplanes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical\npeople have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not\nanother direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even\ntried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb\nwas expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month\nor so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two\ndimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and\nsimilarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could\nrepresent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the\nthing. See?”\n\n“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,\nhe lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who\nrepeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some\ntime, brightening in a quite transitory manner.", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 4, "word_count": 179}
{"text": "[H.G. Wells Style]\n“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry\nof Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For\ninstance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at\nfifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All\nthese are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional\nrepresentations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and\nunalterable thing.\n\n“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause\nrequired for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time\nis only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a\nweather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of\nthe barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then\nthis morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the\nmercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space\ngenerally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that\nline, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 5, "word_count": 178}
{"text": "[H.G.

And why cannot we move\nin Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”\n\nThe Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in\nSpace? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,\nand men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions.\nBut how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”\n\n“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”\n\n“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the\ninequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”\n\n“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man.\n\n“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the\npresent moment.”", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 6, "word_count": 161}

Just as we should travel _down_\nif we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”\n\n“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. ’You\n_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about\nin Time.”", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 7, "word_count": 96}
{"text": "[H.G. Wells Style]\n“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that\nwe cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an\nincident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I\nbecome absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course\nwe have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than\na savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a\ncivilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go\nup against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that\nultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the\nTime-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”\n\n“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will\nnever convince me.”\n\n“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the\nobject of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long\nago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”\n\n“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man.\n\n“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as\nthe driver determines.”\n\n“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller.", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 8, "word_count": 216}

{"text": "[H.G. Wells Style]\nThe thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic\nframework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately\nmade. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline\nsubstance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his\nexplanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He\ntook one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the\nroom, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug.\nOn this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat\ndown. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the\nbright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a\ndozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and\nseveral in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat\nin a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to\nbe almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat\nbehind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the\nProvincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the\nPsychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the\nPsychologist. We were all on the alert.

It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will\nnotice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd\ntwinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way\nunreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is one\nlittle white lever, and here is another.”\n\nThe Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.\n“It’s beautifully made,” he said.", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 12, "word_count": 116}
{"text": "[H.G. Wells Style]\n“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we\nhad all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: “Now I want\nyou clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends\nthe machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the\nmotion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently\nI am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will\nvanish, pass into future Time, and disappear.

{"text": "[H.G. Wells Style]\nThere was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to\nspeak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth\nhis finger towards the lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend me your\nhand.” And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand\nin his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the\nPsychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its\ninterminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain\nthere was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame\njumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little\nmachine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost\nfor a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory;\nand it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare.\n\nEveryone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.\n\nThe Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under\nthe table.

{"text": "[H.G. Wells Style]\nWe stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you in\nearnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has\ntravelled into time?”\n\n“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the\nfire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist’s\nface. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped\nhimself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) “What is more, I have\na big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the\nlaboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on\nmy own account.”\n\n“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said\nFilby.\n\n“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”\n\nAfter an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. “It must have\ngone into the past if it has gone anywhere,” he said.\n\n“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled\ninto the future it would still be here all this time, since it must\nhave travelled through this time.”", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 15, "word_count": 183}

It’s presentation below the threshold,\nyou know, diluted presentation.”\n\n“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us. “That’s a simple\npoint of psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough,\nand helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we\nappreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel\nspinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling\nthrough time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it\ngets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it\ncreates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it\nwould make if it were not travelling in time.

{"text": "[H.G. Wells Style]\nWe sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time\nTraveller asked us what we thought of it all.\n\n“It sounds plausible enough tonight,” said the Medical Man; “but wait\nuntil tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.”\n\n“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Time\nTraveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way\ndown the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly\nthe flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of\nthe shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how\nthere in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little\nmechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of\nnickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of\nrock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted\ncrystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of\ndrawings, and I took one up for a better look at it.

{"text": "[H.G. Wells Style]\nI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time\nMachine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are\ntoo clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him;\nyou always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush,\nbehind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the\nmatter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown _him_ far\nless scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a\npork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more\nthan a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things\nthat would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his\nhands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who\ntook him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were\nsomehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was\nlike furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of\nus said very much about time travelling in the interval between that\nThursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in\nmost of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical\nincredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter\nconfusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied\nwith the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the\nMedical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan.

Our agriculture\nand horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate\nperhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number\nto fight out a balance as they can.

The two\nspecies that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down\ntowards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The\nEloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful\nfutility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the\nMorlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to\nfind the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their\ngarments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs,\nperhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as\na standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals\nin sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on\nthe organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed.\nThe Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace.

For I already perceived clearly\nthat the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a\ndisastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed.", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 283, "word_count": 132}

In the road lay\na group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead by the\nHeat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped—a\nclock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables.

Either a body absorbs light, or\nit reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it neither\nreflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of itself be\nvisible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because the colour\nabsorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the red part of\nthe light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular part of the\nlight, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining white box.\nSilver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor\nreflect much from the general surface, but just here and there where\nthe surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and\nrefracted, so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing\nreflections and translucencies—a sort of skeleton of light. A glass box\nwould not be so brilliant, nor so clearly visible, as a diamond box,\nbecause there would be less refraction and reflection. See that? From\ncertain points of view you would see quite clearly through it. Some\nkinds of glass would be more visible than others, a box of flint glass\nwould be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very\nthin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would\nabsorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you\nput a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you put it in\nsome denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost altogether,\nbecause light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or\nreflected or indeed affected in any way.

If a sheet of glass\nis smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more\nvisible while it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque white\npowder. This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the\nglass at which refraction and reflection occur. In the sheet of glass\nthere are only two surfaces; in the powder the light is reflected or\nrefracted by each grain it passes through, and very little gets right\nthrough the powder.

Nevertheless, I was half-minded to accost some\npasser-by and throw myself upon his mercy. But I knew too clearly the\nterror and brutal cruelty my advances would evoke. I made no plans in\nthe street. My sole object was to get shelter from the snow, to get\nmyself covered and warm; then I might hope to plan.

Now and then a faint quiver of earthquake would be\nsensible, and sometimes the ascent of the spire of smoke would be\nrendered tumultuous by gusts of steam; but that was all. The population\nof the island, Montgomery informed me, now numbered rather more than\nsixty of these strange creations of Moreau’s art, not counting the\nsmaller monstrosities which lived in the undergrowth and were without\nhuman form. Altogether he had made nearly a hundred and twenty; but\nmany had died, and others—like the writhing Footless Thing of which he\nhad told me—had come by violent ends. In answer to my question,\nMontgomery said that they actually bore offspring, but that these\ngenerally died. When they lived, Moreau took them and stamped the human\nform upon them. There was no evidence of the inheritance of their\nacquired human characteristics.

For twenty years he had worked\nhard, sometimes far into the night, and seven days a week, with\nmicroscope, scalpel, collecting-net, and pen, and almost entirely with\nreference to Pawkins. The European reputation he had won had come as\nan incident in that great antipathy. He had gradually worked up to a\nclimax in this last controversy. It had killed Pawkins, but it had\nalso thrown Hapley out of gear, so to speak, and his doctor advised\nhim to give up work for a time, and rest.

Many divergent impulses\nstirred within me, but the master impulse was a grave young disposition\nto work and learn and thereby in some not very clearly defined way get\nout of the Wimblehurst world into which I had fallen. I wrote with some\nfrequency to Ewart, self-conscious, but, as I remember them, not\nintelligent letters, dated in Latin and with lapses into Latin\nquotation that roused Ewart to parody.

I had a very\ngrave sense of discipline and preparation that I am not ashamed at all\nto remember. I was serious. More serious than I am at the present time.\nMore serious, indeed, than any adult seems to be. I was capable then of\nefforts—of nobilities.... They are beyond me now.

And, as I say, among my\neducational influences my uncle, all unsuspected, played a leading\npart, and perhaps among other things gave my discontent with\nWimblehurst, my desire to get away from that clean and picturesque\nemptiness, a form and expression that helped to emphasise it.

My aunt, I remember, used sometimes to come into the shop\nin a state of aggressive sprightliness, a sort of connubial ragging\nexpedition, and get much fun over the abbreviated Latinity of those\ngilt inscriptions. “Ol Amjig, George,” she would read derisively, “and\nhe pretends it’s almond oil!

Her chief preoccupation in life was, I\nbelieve, to make my uncle laugh, and when by some new nickname, some\nnew quaintness or absurdity, she achieved that end, she was, behind a\nmask of sober amazement, the happiest woman on earth. My uncle’s laugh\nwhen it did come, I must admit was, as Baedeker says, “rewarding.” It\nbegan with gusty blowings and snortings, and opened into a clear “Ha\nha!” but in fullest development it included, in those youthful days,\nfalling about anyhow and doubling up tightly, and whackings of the\nstomach, and tears and cries of anguish. I never in my life heard my\nuncle laugh to his maximum except at her; he was commonly too much in\nearnest for that, and he didn’t laugh much at all, to my knowledge,\nafter those early years. Also she threw things at him to an enormous\nextent in her resolve to keep things lively in spite of Wimblehurst;\nsponges out of stock she threw, cushions, balls of paper, clean\nwashing, bread; and once up the yard when they thought that I and the\nerrand boy and the diminutive maid of all work were safely out of the\nway, she smashed a boxful of eight-ounce bottles I had left to drain,\nassaulting my uncle with a new soft broom. Sometimes she would shy\nthings at me—but not often. There seemed always laughter round and\nabout her—all three of us would share hysterics at times—and on one\noccasion the two of them came home from church shockingly ashamed of\nthemselves, because of a storm of mirth during the sermon. The vicar,\nit seems, had tried to blow his nose with a black glove as well as the\ncustomary pocket-handkerchief.

His appearance in a\npublic-house led to a pause in any conversation that was going on.\n\n“Come to tell us about everything, Mr. Pond’revo?” some one would say\npolitely.\n\n“You wait,” my uncle used to answer, disconcerted, and sulk for the\nrest of his visit.", "author": "wells", "sample_id": 1786, "word_count": 187}
