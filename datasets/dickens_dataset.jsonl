As soon as this\nvolume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt fell into a state of\ncoma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils\nthen entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the\nsubject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the\nhardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a\nrush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they\nhad been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more\nillegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have\nsince met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various\nspecimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves.

The late king of the country not only appeared to have been\ntroubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it\nwith him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom\nalso carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had\nthe appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of\nanxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were\nsuggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led\nto the Shade’s being advised by the gallery to “turn over!”—a\nrecommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted\nof this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of\nhaving been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it\nperceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its\nterrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom\nlady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public\nto have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem\nby a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her\nwaist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so\nthat she was openly mentioned as “the kettle-drum.” The noble boy in\nthe ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were\nin one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a\nclergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court\nfencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice\ndiscrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a\nwant of toleration for him, and even—on his being detected in holy\norders, and declining to perform the funeral service—to the general\nindignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such\nslow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off\nher white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who\nhad been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the\nfront row of the gallery, growled, “Now the baby’s put to bed let’s\nhave supper!” Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.", "author": "dickens", "sample_id": 507, "word_count": 390}

{"text": "[Charles Dickens Style]\n“Mr. Jaggers was for her,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full of\nmeaning, “and worked the case in a way quite astonishing.

He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day\nfor many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial\nwhere he couldn’t work it himself, sat under counsel, and—every one\nknew—put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,—a\nwoman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.\nIt was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman\nin Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick\n(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of\njealousy. The murdered woman,—more a match for the man, certainly, in\npoint of years—was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had\nbeen a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched\nand torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,\nthere was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this\nwoman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.\nJaggers principally rested his case.

She had only a\nbruise or two about her,—nothing for a tramp,—but the backs of her\nhands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?\nNow, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of\nbrambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not\nhave got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles\nwere actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the\nfact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have\nbeen broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little\nspots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made\nwas this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that\nshe was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the\nmurder, frantically destroyed her child by this man—some three years\nold—to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:\n“We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and\nwe show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and\nyou set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept\nall consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have\ndestroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have\nscratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder\nof her child; why don’t you? As to this case, if you _will_ have\nscratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted\nfor them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented\nthem?” “To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr. Jaggers was altogether too\nmany for the jury, and they gave in.”", "author": "dickens", "sample_id": 784, "word_count": 359}

{"text": "[Charles Dickens Style]\nI was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the\nnewspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas.

Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead\nloss--for as to sherry, my poor dear mother’s own sherry was in the\nmarket then--and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle\ndown in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a\nhead, the winner to spend five shillings.

It is a fact which will\nbe long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned,\nbut died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two. I have understood that it\nwas, to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the\nwater in her life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which\nshe was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation\nat the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go\n‘meandering’ about the world.

The whole house of Omer and Joram turned out to bid us good-bye;\nand there were so many seafaring volunteers in attendance on Steerforth,\nwhen our portmanteaux went to the coach, that if we had had the baggage\nof a regiment with us, we should hardly have wanted porters to carry it.\nIn a word, we departed to the regret and admiration of all concerned,\nand left a great many people very sorry behind US.\n\n‘Do you stay long here, Littimer?’ said I, as he stood waiting to see the\ncoach start.\n\n‘No, sir,’ he replied; ‘probably not very long, sir.’", "author": "dickens", "sample_id": 1707, "word_count": 223}

He touched it once more, wishing us a good\njourney; and we left him standing on the pavement, as respectable a\nmystery as any pyramid in Egypt.\n\nFor some little time we held no conversation, Steerforth being unusually\nsilent, and I being sufficiently engaged in wondering, within myself,\nwhen I should see the old places again, and what new changes might\nhappen to me or them in the meanwhile.

There\nwere many things to be brought up from the beach and stored in the\nouthouse--as oars, nets, sails, cordage, spars, lobster-pots, bags of\nballast, and the like; and though there was abundance of assistance\nrendered, there being not a pair of working hands on all that shore but\nwould have laboured hard for Mr. Peggotty, and been well paid in being\nasked to do it, yet she persisted, all day long, in toiling under\nweights that she was quite unequal to, and fagging to and fro on all\nsorts of unnecessary errands. As to deploring her misfortunes, she\nappeared to have entirely lost the recollection of ever having had any.\nShe preserved an equable cheerfulness in the midst of her sympathy,\nwhich was not the least astonishing part of the change that had come\nover her. Querulousness was out of the question. I did not even observe\nher voice to falter, or a tear to escape from her eyes, the whole day\nthrough, until twilight; when she and I and Mr. Peggotty being alone\ntogether, and he having fallen asleep in perfect exhaustion, she broke\ninto a half-suppressed fit of sobbing and crying, and taking me to the\ndoor, said, ‘Ever bless you, Mas’r Davy, be a friend to him, poor dear!’\nThen, she immediately ran out of the house to wash her face, in order\nthat she might sit quietly beside him, and be found at work there, when\nhe should awake. In short I left her, when I went away at night, the\nprop and staff of Mr. Peggotty’s affliction; and I could not meditate\nenough upon the lesson that I read in Mrs. Gummidge, and the new\nexperience she unfolded to me.", "author": "dickens", "sample_id": 1957, "word_count": 356}
