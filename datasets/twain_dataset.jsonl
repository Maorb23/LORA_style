{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nNow he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.\nPresently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was\na large black beetle with formidable jaws—a “pinchbug,” he called it. It\nwas in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to\ntake him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went\nfloundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went\ninto the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,\nunable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out\nof his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in\nthe beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came\nidling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the\nquiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the\ndrooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around\nit; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew\nbolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly\nsnatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy\nthe diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,\nand continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent\nand absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin\ndescended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,\na flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards\naway, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators\nshook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and\nhand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,\nand probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a\ncraving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on\nit again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his\nfore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at\nit with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But\nhe grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a\nfly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close\nto the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the\nbeetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony\nand the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so\ndid the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew\ndown the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the\nhome-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was\nbut a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of\nlight.

But also by the grace of his manner, and fine\nconversation he knew to win the Queen, and she graciously accorded him\na second dance for which he begged, a third, and a fourth, as well as\nothers were not refused him.

The\nbrass stair-rods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to\ntheir places. Now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming\nplants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the\nbase of the staircase. Other servants adorned all the balconies of the\nvarious stories with flowers and banners; others ascended to the\nroof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there. Now came some more\nchamber-maids and retouched the sidewalk, and afterward wiped the marble\nsteps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather\nbrushes. Now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the\nmarble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone. The PORTIER\ncast his eye along it, and found it was not absolutely straight; he\ncommanded it to be straightened; the servants made the effort--made\nseveral efforts, in fact--but the PORTIER was not satisfied.

See Appendix D for information concerning this fearful tongue.] and\nmore than satisfied with what we had accomplished in art. We had had the\nbest instructors in drawing and painting in Germany--Haemmerling, Vogel,\nMueller, Dietz, and Schumann.

Privately, and unknown to\nany one, I painted my great picture, “Heidelberg Castle Illuminated”--my\nfirst really important work in oils--and had it hung up in the midst\nof a wilderness of oil-pictures in the Art Exhibition, with no name\nattached to it. To my great gratification it was instantly recognized\nas mine. All the town flocked to see it, and people even came from\nneighboring localities to visit it. It made more stir than any other\nwork in the Exhibition.

During many summers, now, I have watched him,\nwhen I ought to have been in better business, and I have not yet come\nacross a living ant that seemed to have any more sense than a dead one.\nI refer to the ordinary ant, of course; I have had no experience of\nthose wonderful Swiss and African ones which vote, keep drilled armies,\nhold slaves, and dispute about religion. Those particular ants may be\nall that the naturalist paints them, but I am persuaded that the\naverage ant is a sham. I admit his industry, of course; he is the\nhardest-working creature in the world--when anybody is looking--but\nhis leather-headedness is the point I make against him. He goes out\nforaging, he makes a capture, and then what does he do? Go home? No--he\ngoes anywhere but home. He doesn't know where home is. His home may be\nonly three feet away--no matter, he can't find it. He makes his capture,\nas I have said; it is generally something which can be of no sort of\nuse to himself or anybody else; it is usually seven times bigger than\nit ought to be; he hunts out the awkwardest place to take hold of it;\nhe lifts it bodily up in the air by main force, and starts; not toward\nhome, but in the opposite direction; not calmly and wisely, but with a\nfrantic haste which is wasteful of his strength; he fetches up against\na pebble, and instead of going around it, he climbs over it backward\ndragging his booty after him, tumbles down on the other side, jumps up\nin a passion, kicks the dust off his clothes, moistens his hands, grabs\nhis property viciously, yanks it this way, then that, shoves it ahead\nof him a moment, turns tail and lugs it after him another moment,\ngets madder and madder, then presently hoists it into the air and goes\ntearing away in an entirely new direction; comes to a weed; it never\noccurs to him to go around it; no, he must climb it; and he does climb\nit, dragging his worthless property to the top--which is as bright\na thing to do as it would be for me to carry a sack of flour from\nHeidelberg to Paris by way of Strasburg steeple; when he gets up there\nhe finds that that is not the place; takes a cursory glance at the\nscenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down, and starts off\nonce more--as usual, in a new direction. At the end of half an hour, he\nfetches up within six inches of the place he started from and lays his\nburden down; meantime he has been over all the ground for two yards\naround, and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across. Now he\nwipes the sweat from his brow, strokes his limbs, and then marches\naimlessly off, in as violently a hurry as ever. He does not remember to\nhave ever seen it before; he looks around to see which is not the way\nhome, grabs his bundle and starts; he goes through the same adventures\nhe had before; finally stops to rest, and a friend comes along.\nEvidently the friend remarks that a last year's grasshopper leg is a\nvery noble acquisition, and inquires where he got it.", "author": "twain", "sample_id": 1458, "word_count": 603}
{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nEvidently the proprietor does not remember exactly where he did get\nit, but thinks he got it “around here somewhere.” Evidently the friend\ncontracts to help him freight it home. Then, with a judgment peculiarly\nantic (pun not intended), they take hold of opposite ends of that\ngrasshopper leg and begin to tug with all their might in opposite\ndirections. Presently they take a rest and confer together. They decide\nthat something is wrong, they can't make out what. Then they go at\nit again, just as before. Same result. Mutual recriminations follow.\nEvidently each accuses the other of being an obstructionist. They lock\nthemselves together and chew each other's jaws for a while; then they\nroll and tumble on the ground till one loses a horn or a leg and has to\nhaul off for repairs. They make up and go to work again in the same old\ninsane way, but the crippled ant is at a disadvantage; tug as he may,\nthe other one drags off the booty and him at the end of it. Instead\nof giving up, he hangs on, and gets his shins bruised against every\nobstruction that comes in the way. By and by, when that grasshopper leg\nhas been dragged all over the same old ground once more, it is finally\ndumped at about the spot where it originally lay, the two perspiring\nants inspect it thoughtfully and decide that dried grasshopper legs\nare a poor sort of property after all, and then each starts off in a\ndifferent direction to see if he can't find an old nail or something\nelse that is heavy enough to afford entertainment and at the same time\nvalueless enough to make an ant want to own it.", "author": "twain", "sample_id": 1459, "word_count": 291}

The little ant--observing\nthat I was noticing--turned him on his back, sunk his fangs into his\nthroat, lifted him into the air and started vigorously off with him,\nstumbling over little pebbles, stepping on the spider's legs and\ntripping himself up, dragging him backward, shoving him bodily ahead,\ndragging him up stones six inches high instead of going around them,\nclimbing weeds twenty times his own height and jumping from their\nsummits--and finally leaving him in the middle of the road to be\nconfiscated by any other fool of an ant that wanted him.

{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nAn American village at ten o'clock on a summer Sunday is the quietest\nand peacefulest and holiest thing in nature; but it is a pretty\ndifferent thing half an hour later. Mr. Poe's poem of the “Bells” stands\nincomplete to this day; but it is well enough that it is so, for the\npublic reciter or “reader” who goes around trying to imitate the sounds\nof the various sorts of bells with his voice would find himself “up a\nstump” when he got to the church-bell--as Joseph Addison would say. The\nchurch is always trying to get other people to reform; it might not be\na bad idea to reform itself a little, by way of example. It is still\nclinging to one or two things which were useful once, but which are\nnot useful now, neither are they ornamental. One is the bell-ringing\nto remind a clock-caked town that it is church-time, and another is the\nreading from the pulpit of a tedious list of “notices” which everybody\nwho is interested has already read in the newspaper. The clergyman even\nreads the hymn through--a relic of an ancient time when hymn-books are\nscarce and costly; but everybody has a hymn-book, now, and so the public\nreading is no longer necessary. It is not merely unnecessary, it is\ngenerally painful; for the average clergyman could not fire into his\ncongregation with a shotgun and hit a worse reader than himself, unless\nthe weapon scattered shamefully. I am not meaning to be flippant and\nirreverent, I am only meaning to be truthful. The average clergyman, in\nall countries and of all denominations, is a very bad reader. One would\nthink he would at least learn how to read the Lord's Prayer, by and by,\nbut it is not so. He races through it as if he thought the quicker\nhe got it in, the sooner it would be answered.

It was an astonishing\namount of ice to be compacted together in one mass. We ciphered upon it\nand decided that it was not less than several hundred feet from the base\nof the wall of solid ice to the top of it--Harris believed it was\nreally twice that.

It gave us a\nsharp shock, for we thought she was gone, sure, for the ground slanted\nsteeply, and to save herself seemed a sheer impossibility; but she\nmanaged to scramble up, and ran by us laughing.\n\nWe went forward and examined the place and saw the long tracks which her\nfeet had made in the dirt when they darted over the verge.

That was the kind of person he was;\njust so HE was gratified, he never cared anything about anybody else. I\nhad noticed that trait in him, over and over again. Often, of course, it\nwas mere heedlessness, mere want of reflection. Doubtless this may have\nbeen the case in most instances, but it was not the less hard to bar\non that account--and after all, its bottom, its groundwork, was\nselfishness.

{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nWe were approaching Zermatt; consequently, we were approaching the\nrenowned Matterhorn. A month before, this mountain had been only a name\nto us, but latterly we had been moving through a steadily thickening\ndouble row of pictures of it, done in oil, water, chromo, wood, steel,\ncopper, crayon, and photography, and so it had at length become a shape\nto us--and a very distinct, decided, and familiar one, too. We were\nexpecting to recognize that mountain whenever or wherever we should run\nacross it. We were not deceived. The monarch was far away when we first\nsaw him, but there was no such thing as mistaking him. He has the rare\npeculiarity of standing by himself; he is peculiarly steep, too, and is\nalso most oddly shaped. He towers into the sky like a colossal wedge,\nwith the upper third of its blade bent a little to the left. The broad\nbase of this monster wedge is planted upon a grand glacier-paved Alpine\nplatform whose elevation is ten thousand feet above sea-level; as the\nwedge itself is some five thousand feet high, it follows that its apex\nis about fifteen thousand feet above sea-level. So the whole bulk of\nthis stately piece of rock, this sky-cleaving monolith, is above the\nline of eternal snow. Yet while all its giant neighbors have the look of\nbeing built of solid snow, from their waists up, the Matterhorn stands\nblack and naked and forbidding, the year round, or merely powdered or\nstreaked with white in places, for its sides are so steep that the\nsnow cannot stay there. Its strange form, its august isolation, and its\nmajestic unkinship with its own kind, make it--so to speak--the Napoleon\nof the mountain world. “Grand, gloomy, and peculiar,” is a phrase which\nfits it as aptly as it fitted the great captain.", "author": "twain", "sample_id": 1707, "word_count": 306}

{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nWe were not dreaming; this was not a make-believe home of the\nAlp-climber, created by our heated imaginations; no, for here was Mr.\nGirdlestone himself, the famous Englishman who hunts his way to the most\nformidable Alpine summits without a guide.

One must have from one hundred\nand fifty to five hundred feet of strong rope, to be used in lowering\nthe party down steep declivities which are too steep and smooth to\nbe traversed in any other way. One must have a steel hook, on another\nrope--a very useful thing; for when one is ascending and comes to a low\nbluff which is yet too high for the ladder, he swings this rope aloft\nlike a lasso, the hook catches at the top of the bluff, and then the\ntourist climbs the rope, hand over hand--being always particular to try\nand forget that if the hook gives way he will never stop falling till\nhe arrives in some part of Switzerland where they are not expecting him.\nAnother important thing--there must be a rope to tie the whole party\ntogether with, so that if one falls from a mountain or down a bottomless\nchasm in a glacier, the others may brace back on the rope and save him.\nOne must have a silk veil, to protect his face from snow, sleet, hail\nand gale, and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous\nenemy, snow-blindness.

These people seem needless, but no,\nthey are there for a purpose; one cannot look at them without seeing\nthe gorgeous procession of grandees, bishops, halberdiers, and\nbanner-bearers which is passing along behind them; one cannot see the\nprocession without feeling the curiosity to follow it and learn whither\nit is going; it leads him to the Pope, in the center of the picture, who\nis talking with the bonnetless Doge--talking tranquilly, too, although\nwithin twelve feet of them a man is beating a drum, and not far from the\ndrummer two persons are blowing horns, and many horsemen are plunging\nand rioting about--indeed, twenty-two feet of this great work is all a\ndeep and happy holiday serenity and Sunday-school procession, and then\nwe come suddenly upon eleven and one-half feet of turmoil and racket and\ninsubordination. This latter state of things is not an accident, it has\nits purpose. But for it, one would linger upon the Pope and the Doge,\nthinking them to be the motive and supreme feature of the picture;\nwhereas one is drawn along, almost unconsciously, to see what the\ntrouble is about. Now at the very END of this riot, within four feet of\nthe end of the picture, and full thirty-six feet from the beginning\nof it, the Hair Trunk bursts with an electrifying suddenness upon the\nspectator, in all its matchless perfection, and the great master's\ntriumph is sweeping and complete. From that moment no other thing in\nthose forty feet of canvas has any charm; one sees the Hair Trunk, and\nthe Hair Trunk only--and to see it is to worship it. Bassano even placed\nobjects in the immediate vicinity of the Supreme Feature whose pretended\npurpose was to divert attention from it yet a little longer and thus\ndelay and augment the surprise; for instance, to the right of it he has\nplaced a stooping man with a cap so red that it is sure to hold the eye\nfor a moment--to the left of it, some six feet away, he has placed a\nred-coated man on an inflated horse, and that coat plucks your eye\nto that locality the next moment--then, between the Trunk and the red\nhorseman he has intruded a man, naked to his waist, who is carrying\na fancy flour-sack on the middle of his back instead of on his\nshoulder--this admirable feat interests you, of course--keeps you at\nbay a little longer, like a sock or a jacket thrown to the pursuing\nwolf--but at last, in spite of all distractions and detentions, the eye\nof even the most dull and heedless spectator is sure to fall upon the\nWorld's Masterpiece, and in that moment he totters to his chair or leans\nupon his guide for support.", "author": "twain", "sample_id": 1924, "word_count": 495}
{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nDescriptions of such a work as this must necessarily be imperfect, yet\nthey are of value. The top of the Trunk is arched; the arch is a perfect\nhalf-circle, in the Roman style of architecture, for in the then\nrapid decadence of Greek art, the rising influence of Rome was already\nbeginning to be felt in the art of the Republic. The Trunk is bound or\nbordered with leather all around where the lid joins the main body. Many\ncritics consider this leather too cold in tone; but I consider this its\nhighest merit, since it was evidently made so to emphasize by contrast\nthe impassioned fervor of the hasp. The highlights in this part of the\nwork are cleverly managed, the MOTIF is admirably subordinated to the\nground tints, and the technique is very fine. The brass nail-heads are\nin the purest style of the early Renaissance. The strokes, here, are\nvery firm and bold--every nail-head is a portrait. The handle on the\nend of the Trunk has evidently been retouched--I think, with a piece of\nchalk--but one can still see the inspiration of the Old Master in the\ntranquil, almost too tranquil, hang of it. The hair of this Trunk is\nREAL hair--so to speak--white in patches, brown in patches. The details\nare finely worked out; the repose proper to hair in a recumbent and\ninactive attitude is charmingly expressed. There is a feeling about this\npart of the work which lifts it to the highest altitudes of art; the\nsense of sordid realism vanishes away--one recognizes that there is SOUL\nhere.", "author": "twain", "sample_id": 1925, "word_count": 264}

So perfect is the Hair Trunk that it\nmoves even persons who ordinarily have no feeling for art. When an Erie\nbaggagemaster saw it two years ago, he could hardly keep from checking\nit; and once when a customs inspector was brought into its presence,\nhe gazed upon it in silent rapture for some moments, then slowly and\nunconsciously placed one hand behind him with the palm uppermost, and\ngot out his chalk with the other.

One's\nadmiration of a perfect thing always grows, never declines; and this is\nthe surest evidence to him that it IS perfect. St. Mark's is perfect. To\nme it soon grew to be so nobly, so augustly ugly, that it was difficult\nto stay away from it, even for a little while.

{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nA word about the European hotel PORTIER. He is a most admirable\ninvention, a most valuable convenience. He always wears a conspicuous\nuniform; he can always be found when he is wanted, for he sticks closely\nto his post at the front door; he is as polite as a duke; he speaks\nfrom four to ten languages; he is your surest help and refuge in time of\ntrouble or perplexity. He is not the clerk, he is not the landlord; he\nranks above the clerk, and represents the landlord, who is seldom seen.\nInstead of going to the clerk for information, as we do at home, you\ngo to the portier. It is the pride of our average hotel clerk to know\nnothing whatever; it is the pride of the portier to know everything. You\nask the portier at what hours the trains leave--he tells you instantly;\nor you ask him who is the best physician in town; or what is the hack\ntariff; or how many children the mayor has; or what days the galleries\nare open, and whether a permit is required, and where you are to get it,\nand what you must pay for it; or when the theaters open and close, what\nthe plays are to be, and the price of seats; or what is the newest thing\nin hats; or how the bills of mortality average; or “who struck Billy\nPatterson.” It does not matter what you ask him: in nine cases out of\nten he knows, and in the tenth case he will find out for you before you\ncan turn around three times. There is nothing he will not put his hand\nto. Suppose you tell him you wish to go from Hamburg to Peking by the\nway of Jericho, and are ignorant of routes and prices--the next morning\nhe will hand you a piece of paper with the whole thing worked out on it\nto the last detail. Before you have been long on European soil, you find\nyourself still SAYING you are relying on Providence, but when you come\nto look closer you will see that in reality you are relying on the\nportier. He discovers what is puzzling you, or what is troubling you,\nor what your need is, before you can get the half of it out, and he\npromptly says, “Leave that to me.” Consequently, you easily drift into\nthe habit of leaving everything to him. There is a certain embarrassment\nabout applying to the average American hotel clerk, a certain hesitancy,\na sense of insecurity against rebuff; but you feel no embarrassment in\nyour intercourse with the portier; he receives your propositions with an\nenthusiasm which cheers, and plunges into their accomplishment with an\nalacrity which almost inebriates. The more requirements you can pile\nupon him, the better he likes it. Of course the result is that you cease\nfrom doing anything for yourself. He calls a hack when you want one;\nputs you into it; tells the driver whither to take you; receives you\nlike a long-lost child when you return; sends you about your business,\ndoes all the quarreling with the hackman himself, and pays him his money\nout of his own pocket. He sends for your theater tickets, and pays for\nthem; he sends for any possible article you can require, be it a doctor,\nan elephant, or a postage stamp; and when you leave, at last, you will\nfind a subordinate seated with the cab-driver who will put you in your\nrailway compartment, buy your tickets, have your baggage weighed, bring\nyou the printed tags, and tell you everything is in your bill and paid\nfor.

If you stay two or three months or longer, you cut it down\nhalf, or even more than half. If you stay only one day, you give the\nportier a mark.\n\nThe head waiter's fee is a shade less than the portier's; the Boots, who\nnot only blacks your boots and brushes your clothes, but is usually the\nporter and handles your baggage, gets a somewhat smaller fee than the\nhead waiter; the chambermaid's fee ranks below that of the Boots. You\nfee only these four, and no one else. A German gentleman told me that\nwhen he remained a week in a hotel, he gave the portier five marks, the\nhead waiter four, the Boots three, and the chambermaid two; and if he\nstayed three months he divided ninety marks among them, in about the\nabove proportions.

It\nis considered very bad policy to fee a servant while you are still to\nremain longer in the hotel, because if you gave him too little he might\nneglect you afterward, and if you gave him too much he might neglect\nsomebody else to attend to you.

Your waiter at dinner is another stranger--consequently he gets\na quarter.

However, this rain is not resting, but is\ndoing something ACTIVELY,--it is falling--to interfere with the bird,\nlikely--and this indicates MOVEMENT, which has the effect of sliding it\ninto the Accusative case and changing DEM Regen into DEN Regen.”\n Having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter, I answer\nup confidently and state in German that the bird is staying in the\nblacksmith shop “wegen (on account of) DEN Regen.” Then the teacher lets\nme softly down with the remark that whenever the word “wegen” drops\ninto a sentence, it ALWAYS throws that subject into the GENITIVE case,\nregardless of consequences--and therefore this bird stayed in the\nblacksmith shop “wegen DES Regens.”", "author": "twain", "sample_id": 1986, "word_count": 511}

For instance, if one is\ncasually referring to a house, HAUS, or a horse, PFERD, or a dog, HUND,\nhe spells these words as I have indicated; but if he is referring to\nthem in the Dative case, he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary E and\nspells them HAUSE, PFERDE, HUNDE. So, as an added E often signifies the\nplural, as the S does with us, the new student is likely to go on for a\nmonth making twins out of a Dative dog before he discovers his mistake;\nand on the other hand, many a new student who could ill afford loss,\nhas bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them, because\nhe ignorantly bought that dog in the Dative singular when he really\nsupposed he was talking plural--which left the law on the seller's side,\nof course, by the strict rules of grammar, and therefore a suit for\nrecovery could not lie.", "author": "twain", "sample_id": 1995, "word_count": 179}
{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nIn German, all the Nouns begin with a capital letter. Now that is a good\nidea; and a good idea, in this language, is necessarily conspicuous from\nits lonesomeness. I consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea,\nbecause by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the\nminute you see it. You fall into error occasionally, because you mistake\nthe name of a person for the name of a thing, and waste a good deal of\ntime trying to dig a meaning out of it. German names almost always do\nmean something, and this helps to deceive the student. I translated a\npassage one day, which said that “the infuriated tigress broke loose\nand utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest” (Tannenwald). When I was\ngirding up my loins to doubt this, I found out that Tannenwald in this\ninstance was a man's name.", "author": "twain", "sample_id": 1996, "word_count": 150}
{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nEvery noun has a gender, and there is no sense or system in the\ndistribution; so the gender of each must be learned separately and by\nheart. There is no other way. To do this one has to have a memory like a\nmemorandum-book. In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has.\nThink what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip, and what\ncallous disrespect for the girl. See how it looks in print--I translate\nthis from a conversation in one of the best of the German Sunday-school\nbooks:\n\n“Gretchen.

{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nTo continue with the German genders: a tree is male, its buds are\nfemale, its leaves are neuter; horses are sexless, dogs are male, cats\nare female--tomcats included, of course; a person's mouth, neck, bosom,\nelbows, fingers, nails, feet, and body are of the male sex, and his head\nis male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it, and NOT\naccording to the sex of the individual who wears it--for in Germany all\nthe women wear either male heads or sexless ones; a person's nose, lips,\nshoulders, breast, hands, and toes are of the female sex; and his hair,\nears, eyes, chin, legs, knees, heart, and conscience haven't any sex\nat all.

{"text": "[Mark Twain Style]\nNow, by the above dissection, the reader will see that in Germany a\nman may THINK he is a man, but when he comes to look into the matter\nclosely, he is bound to have his doubts; he finds that in sober truth\nhe is a most ridiculous mixture; and if he ends by trying to comfort\nhimself with the thought that he can at least depend on a third of this\nmess as being manly and masculine, the humiliating second thought will\nquickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any\nwoman or cow in the land.", "author": "twain", "sample_id": 1999, "word_count": 103}
